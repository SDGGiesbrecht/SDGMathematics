[_Begin Feature List_]
- Mathematical operations such as exponents, roots, logarithms, and trigonometry.
- Arbitrary‐precision number types: `WholeNumber`, `Integer` & `RationalNumber`.
- Customizable randomization of numbers and boolean values.
- A hierarchical protocol model for number types: `WholeArithmetic`, `IntegralArithmetic`, `RationalArithmetic`, `RealArithmetic`, etc.
- A `Measurement` protocol to simplify working with differing units.
- Automated reversal of complex functions via `findLocalMinimum(near:within:inFunction)`, etc.
